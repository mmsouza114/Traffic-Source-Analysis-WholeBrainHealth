# YouTube’s Traffic Source Analysis for Whole Brain Health

### In this group project, I was tasked with analyzing the traffic source data from Whole Brain Health's YouTube channel. 

I received data from a total of 13 traffic sources, however, due to the extremely low percentage of views from End screens, Video cards and Annotations, which were less then .008%, I went ahead and removed them from our analysis. Leaving us with a total of 11 traffic sources to work with.

### Between Aug. 1st, 2020 - Dec. 1st, 2022 

I analyzed that there were over 24,000 video views in total.

All top 5 traffic sources had over 1,000 referred views. Suggested Views on its own had over 15,000 referred views, which is an ~63% of all referred views, leaving around 47% of total referred views dispersed among the other 10 traffic sources.

### The traffic sources that had the least amount of referred views were:

* Channel Pages
* Other YouTube features
* Playlists 
* Shorts Feed
* Playlist page
* Notifications

With the exception of channel pages which accounted for 3% of referred views and other youtube features which accounted for 1%. Most of the least trafficked sources brought in less than 50 views.

### During my analysis, I became curious about how many referred views each traffic source had per year. So, I went ahead and created a bar chart for each year for comparison. 

In 2020 there were over 1,300 views from all traffic sources.

In 2021 there were close to 5,800 views.

In 2022 there were well over 16,000 views from all traffic sources. 

It goes without saying, but 2022 brought in the most views, with shorts feeds making its debut and a 300% increase in views referred from suggested videos since 2021.

### In this line chart below I wanted to give a brief overview of the monthly views in general for each year. 

To comment on a few points,(no punt intended) February seems to have had the highest increasae in engagement in each year that had views.
